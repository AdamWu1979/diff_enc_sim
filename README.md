This set of functions can be used to visualize the phase over time for arbitrary field gradients for diffusing particles. An assortment of .gif animations is available in the /animations/ folder.

Start by executing the example code, e.g.
```matlab
	des_example_1    
```
which should render the animation below. Note that the code does not include tools fro making .gif animations, as this is a bit more involved. I may include this in the future if requested.
